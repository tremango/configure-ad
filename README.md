<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project will demonstrate how to configure Remote Desktop for non-administrative users, automate user creation with PowerShell, and manage group policies. Additionally, Iâ€™ll cover account lockouts and log monitoring to simulate a real-life IT environment. Join me as I dive deeper into deploying Active Directory and enhancing system management skills!  <br/>
<br />

You can find the Powershell script I run in this project [here.](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/AD_PS/blob/master/Generate-Names-Create-Users.ps1) 
<br />


<h2>Environments and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Microsoft Azure</b>
- <b>Virtual Machines</b>
- <b>Remote Desktop Connection</b>
- <b>Active Directory</b>

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- <b>Windows Server </b>
- <b>Windows 10</b>

<h2>Project Walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
To start, log into client-1 as the domain admin (jane_admin), using Remote Desktop Connection: <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/W1nAS01.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
I want to allow Remote Desktop for non-administrative users. So, right-click on the start button > System > on the right-side click "Remote Desktop" > "Select users that can remotely access this PC": <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XLBZ0K7.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Here, enter "Domain Users" > Check Names > OK > OK. Now all domain users can access this client via Remote Desktop:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Next, we'll create a bunch of users in Powershell. To start, log into the DC (Domain Controller) as our admin (jane_admin): <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jw8nITi.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Once logged in, open Powershell ISE as an admin and start a new script:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yDauCac.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Use Ctrl + S and save this like so:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VgY2B14.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Now, we can copy and paste the user creation script in the top section and click the "Run" button which has a green play symbol located in the top bar:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2XRBB2C.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Powershell will begin to run the script and create random users and place them in the OU (Organizational Unit), we created in the previous section of this project, named "_EMPLOYEES". We can check by searching "Active Directory Users and Computers" > mydomain.com > _EMPLOYEES. Here we will pick a user and log into client-1 using this username and the password the script sets for all of these users which is "Password1":  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/X9fbOZb.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Now, log out of Jane's account on client-1:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TU8czsa.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
We can log back into client-1 using our newly created user, making sure to specify the context of which we want to log in by adding "mydomain.com\" before the username:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/D12QB9z.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
When we're logged in we can see a user folder for our user if we click on file explorer > C: > Users. We can also see the folder for the other users that have signed into this client. However, we cannot access them, because we don't have those permissions as a user:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z6N0iQB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Now, let's log out of this user, because we are going to set an account lockout group policy and attempt to lock this user out:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EFSeORv.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Go back to our DC and right click the start button > Run > type "gpmc.msc" to bring up the Group Policy Managment Console:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5B60ncN.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Expand Domains > mydomain.com > select Default Domain Policy:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sMRUMIa.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Under Computer Configuration expand Policies > Window Settings > Security Settings > select Account Lockout Policy:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7vkAH1G.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Here we'll select "Account lockout threshhold" and choose to make the account lockout after 5 invalid attempts. Make sure to hit Apply:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7xP0ADr.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
You can double-check this by going to the group policy settings and scrolling down to view the lockout policy:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZaI76lr.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
The policy will update automatically, but it will take some time. We can force the update on client-1 by signing into it as our admin and running "gpupdate /force" in the command line:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6wAP7Pt.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UeDCEv8.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Now, we can sign out of client-1 and attempt to sign back into it with our user with an invalid password 5 times. A lockout message will appear:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jpMNNG4.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FsDli9O.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
To unlock the users account, head back to the DC > Active Directory Users and Computers > mydomain.com > _EMPLOYEES > double-click on the locked out user > Account tab > check the "Unlock account" box:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UUT5jw2.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
(Alternatively you could right-click on the user > Reset Password and there will be a "Unlock users account" option. That way you can change the password at the same time you unlock it):  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4UOG3gY.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Now our user can sign into clinet-1 as normal:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QmlvS55.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
To disable users, go to the DC and in Active Directory Users and Computers > mydomain.com > _EMPLOYEES > right-click on user you want to disable > Disable:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HqbkjOY.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
If we sign out of client-1 now, and try to sign back in using the disabled account, this message will appear:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bVP3LZf.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
To enable the user again go back to the DC and right-click again on the user and select Enable:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/P4aL7iw.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
The user can now log into client-1, so we'll do that and once we are logged in we'll view some logs through the event viewer. To do so, search for "Event Viewer" in the start search bar > Windows Logs > Security. You'll notice we cannot view these:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oQveEHJ.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
This is because we are not an admin. Not to worry, we don't need to sign out of this whole client and sign in as Jane (our admin). We already know her credentials. We just need to close out of this window and open it again, but this time, as an administrator. It will have a pop-up asking for admin credentials:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/u96rZar.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Now, if we navigate back to the security log page, we can view them:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/25pXQAI.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Here we can see a bunch of different information like successful and failed log on attempts, who attempted them and from what IP address, along with the date and time they happened:  <br/>

<br />
